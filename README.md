## Requirements

- Construct a page allowing users to search for names, displaying a list of matching
individuals. Take inspiration from the torre.ai search.
- Additionally, please implement one or both of the following features:
• Display a list showcasing up to 10 of the most recent search queries.
• Provide an option for users to save or favorite individuals and ensure this list is easily
accessible.
- Upon clicking a search result, users should be directed to their genome. This can be either
directly on torre.ai or through your own implementation. Your choice!

## Resources:
You can access these endpoints:

    POST https://torre.ai/api/entities/_searchstream
    WEB https://arda.torre.co/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html

    WEB https://search.torre.co/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html
    (more search-reLated endpoints)

    GET https://torre.bio/api/bios/$username
    (retrieves the genome information of username)

If you need examples of how they work, you can check the page network requests in your
browser when retrieving or modifying information on torre.al.

## Deliverables
Please provide links to:
• The live, production-ready environment where we can test your implementation.
• A version control system that will allow us to review your incremental progress.

Additionally, write a paragraph addressing the question:
If you had more time, what additional improvements would you have considered?
